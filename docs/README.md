# Data Analysis Project: 
## Analyzing GDP evolution over time from Latin American Countries

This project was developed to show basic operations with DataFrames using the Pandas library.
At the end the notebook includes several visualizations to convey information in a more simplistic, graphical way.

The requirements.txt has all the libraries (and their versions) used in the notebook.
To install use command: pip install -r requirements.txt. Remember to activate a virtual environment first!
