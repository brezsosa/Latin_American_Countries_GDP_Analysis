# Data Analysis Project: 

### Analyzing the Latin American countries GDP evolution over the 2000 - 2018 period

In the repository I included the csv file containing the dataset that I used.

This project was developed to show basic operations with DataFrames using the Pandas library.
At the end the notebook includes several visualizations to convey information in a more simplistic, graphical way.

The requirements.txt has all the libraries (and their versions) used in the notebook.
To install use command: pip install -r requirements.txt. Remember to activate a virtual environment first!
